## Hi there 👋

I am currently working as a Master Thesis Intern at Stedin B.V., which is one of the six Distribution System Operators in the Netherlands accountable for most of the areas in South-Holland and Utrecht provinces.



- 🔭 Current research directions:
    - State and Parameter Estimation of Distribution Power Grids
    - Graph and Simplicial Complex Neural Networks
    - Optimal Power Flow 
      
      
- 🌱 Future is exciting: I’m learning and testing the paradigms of Generative AI, in particular implicit density based methods to solve the observability problems across the MV/LV Power Grids. 

## 🚀 Frameworks

Small set, Big Impact.
