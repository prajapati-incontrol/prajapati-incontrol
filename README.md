## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Soham Prajapati, currently working as an independent researcher in the domain of electrical power grids and machine learning. 


- ðŸ”­ Current research directions:
    - State and Parameter Estimation of Distribution Power Grids
    - Graph and Simplicial Complex Neural Networks
    - Generative Machine Learning
      
      
- ðŸŒ± Future is exciting:  Iâ€™m exploring Deep Reinforcement Learning to integrate reward networks into my ML projects, using feedback from external power system tools like PSCAD and PowerFactory.
  
## ðŸš€ Frameworks

Small set, Big Impact.
